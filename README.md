# Predicting-Health-Insurance-Costs-Using-Demographic-and-Lifestyle-Factors-A-Regression-Analysis

This project seeks to build a predictive model that accurately predicts insurance charges using a dataset containing features such as age, sex, 
BMI, number of children, smoking status, and geographic region.  The primary goals of this project are as follows:

 1. Predictive Modeling: Develop a regression model that accurately predicts insurance charges 
based on the provided features. This model will help quantify the impact of individual factors on 
insurance costs.
 2. Feature Impact Analysis: Identify and interpret key predictors affecting insurance charges, such 
as the influence of smoking status or BMI on cost variations.
 3. Multicollinearity and Autocorrelation Checks: Investigate multicollinearity among predictors to 
ensure that variables are not excessively correlated, which can skew model performance and 
interpretability. Additionally, check for autocorrelation in residuals to verify the assumptions of 
independence in regression models, improving model reliability.
 4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate and compare model performance, using metrics such as mean 
absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), to determine the accuracy and 
robustness of the developed model.
